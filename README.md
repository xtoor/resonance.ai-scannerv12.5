## 📦 Deployment

### Local (Python 3.10+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/resonance-breakout-scanner.git
cd resonance-breakout-scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
python breakout_scanner.py
```

### Cloud (Railway / Render / etc.) (More on this coming soon)

- Add environment variables in your service dashboard

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Discord webhook URL is correct and active.
- Check your internet connection and API rate limits.
- Adjust `ABS_VOL_MIN_USD` if you see too many or too few alerts.
- Use simple mode (`SIMPLE_MODE=1`) for faster, less detailed alerts.
- Use pro mode (`SIMPLE_MODE=0`) for detailed analytics.
